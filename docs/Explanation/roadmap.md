Below is the roadmap for the Nginx Ingress Integrator Operator.

## October 2022 to April 2023
* Documentation improvements - updating the home page, integrating the [Diataxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/) and including project governance information.
* Upgrade [python kubernetes library](https://github.com/canonical/nginx-ingress-integrator-operator/blob/main/requirements.txt). Currently the charm is using an older version of the python kubernetes library, and we will update it to use a more recent version, taking into account supported versions of Kubernetes.
